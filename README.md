# Pyrenees in CORDEX

Collaborative codebase to investigate the present and future Pyrenees climate in the Coordinated Regional climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX).

## Introduction

CORDEX is an internationally coordinated effort to produce high-resolution regional climate model data for several of the world's key regions. Boundary conditions for the regions are provided by an ensemble of General Circulation Models (GCMs), with high-resolution Regional Climate Models (RCMs) handling the dynamics within the region. The project has standardised a number of experiments for each GCM-RCM pair to run, including a historical run and one for each Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP). The full dataset can be browsed manually at https://esgf-data.dkrz.de/search/cordex-dkrz/. For the Pyrenees, the region of interest has the code 'EUR-11'.

## Field Trip Workshop

We would love to run a climate model as part of our workshop, but I unfortunately forgot to pack my supercomputer, so I'm afraid this workshop is limited to analysing the output data of climate models. This means there's slightly less room for model tweaking and fun exploration, but hopefully you can get a sense of what climate models are doing and how we use them to investigate future climates.

### Instructions

No downloads or installations are required to run this practical. All the notebooks, data, and software is available in a binder, which can be accessed at the following address:

Once you've accessed the binder, open the file `cordex_tutorial.ipynb` and click through the jupyter notebook. If you're not familiar with python, there's no need to think too much about the code and what it's doing. Simply read through the comments explaining what is going on and have a look at the plots generated. However, do feel free to tweak aspects of the code if you'd like to explore what is possible with geospatial data.
